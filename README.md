## What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

## My motivation

While working on multiple internship interviews, Software Engineering courses (at <a ref="https://www.42sp.org.br/">42 SÃ£o Paulo</a> and Anhanguera), and a FullStack Developer Course at <a ref="https://texperts.com.br/">T.EX</a>, I saw a need to hone my logical thinking and algorithms and data structure knowledge.

So whenever I have some free time, I will strive to work on Project Euler problems and do my best to become a better Software Developer.
